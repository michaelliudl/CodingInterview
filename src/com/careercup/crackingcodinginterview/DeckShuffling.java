/**
 * Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards.
 * It must be a perfect shuffleâ€”in other words, each of the 52! permutations of the deck has to be equally likely.
 * Assume that you are given a random number generator which is perfect.

/**
 * This is a very well-known interview question, and a well-known algorithm.
 * If you aren't one of the lucky few to already know this algorithm, read on.
 * Let's imagine our n-element array. Suppose it looks like this:
 * [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
 * Using our Base Case and Build approach, we can ask this question: suppose we had a method shuffle(...)
 * that worked on n - 1 elements. Could we use this to shuffle n elements?
 * Sure. In fact, that's quite easy. We would first shuffle the first n - 1 elements.
 * Then, we would take the nth element and randomly swap it with an element in the array.That's it!
